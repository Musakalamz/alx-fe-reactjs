# ⚛️ ALX Fundamentals and Core Concepts of React

This repository contains the solution code for the **Fundamentals and Core Concepts of React** project, part of the ALX Front-End Web Development curriculum. The project focuses on building a solid foundation in React, a powerful JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, using **Vite** as the build tool.

## ✨ Project Objectives

The primary goals of this project are to gain practical experience and a fundamental understanding of:

* **Understanding React Basics:** What React is and how to set up a modern React application using **Vite**.
* **Working with JSX and ReactDOM:** Familiarity with the syntax extension JSX and the role of ReactDOM.
* **Creating and Managing Components:** Developing functional components and understanding component structure.
* **Component Composition and Props:** Learning to assemble multiple components and pass data using **props**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
* **npm** or **yarn** (npm is used in the instructions)
* **Git**

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alx-fe-reactjs.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alx-fe-reactjs.git)
    cd alx-fe-reactjs
    ```

2.  **Create the React Application**
    The project uses **Vite** to scaffold the React application.
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest alx-react-app -- --template react
    ```

3.  **Navigate and Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    cd alx-react-app
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the Application**
    This command starts the development server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
